# Lessons Learned from Modifying and Pushing the Repository

Hi, this is what I learned from cloning, deploying, and making some modifications based on the Typecho project. I pushed my modified edition to my own repo. Here is what I learned:  

To begin withï¼ŒI gain a deeper understanding of Markdown through writing the readme.md and website.md. Besides, I master the skill of git by uploading and modifying my files into github when using git in terminal.
Moreover,when deploying my website,I also gained a new understanding of the deployment process, including using SSH software to connect to the server, configuring the environment, deploying the website, and resolving the domain name.Last but not the least,in order to beautify the website pages, I also learned some basic HTML, CSS, and JS syntax and understood some common usages.
