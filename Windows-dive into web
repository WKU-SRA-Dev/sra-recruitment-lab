        #Dive into web
Hello everyone，welcome to the lab。I am honored to post a tutorial here. My understand of web and GITHUB still is not mature enough, but hope you can acqiure some help here, I will very happy if this tutorial is helpful for you.
Let's start!
   ## About npm and yarn( I copy the content from Bao,Xinzhi,Windows method is same as the mac)
1. **Install `npm`**
   
   1. Download Node.js Installer:
   - Go to the [Node.js Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/) and download the macOS .pkg installer.
   2. Run the Installer:
   - Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions, agreeing to terms and selecting installation locations as needed.
   3. Verify Installation:
   - Open `Terminal.app` on your mac and run:
     
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   
   . This can confirms the both Node.js and npm are installed correctly.

2. **Install `yarn` via `npm`**
   
   1. Installation:
   - Open `Terminal.app` on your mac and run:
     
     ```bash
     npm install --global yarn
     ```
   2. Check Installation:
   - Check that `yarn` is installed by running:
     
     ```bash
     yarn --version
     ```
  ## About GitHub
1.How to clone a repository to your local mechine
        Step 1: Copy the repository URL
                Go to the repository on GitHub, click the "Code" button, and copy the HTTPS URL.

        Step 2: Run the clone command
                Open your terminal and run:
                bash:
               git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
              ( Replace username and repository-name with the your own actual names.)

        Step 3: Navigate to the project folder
                 Once cloned, move into the project directory with:
                 bash:
                 cd repository-name

2.How can you push your code to your lab's GitHub repository:
       Step 1: Clone the repository and make changes
                 First, clone the lab’s repository to your local machine using the following command:
                 bash:
                 git clone https://github.com/lab-name/repository-name.git
                (Replace lab-name and repository-name with the actual names. Then, make the necessary changes to your code locally.)


      Step 2: Stage and commit your changes
                 Once you’ve made your changes, you need to stage and commit them. Navigate to the project folder and run:
                 bash:
                 git add .
                 git commit -m "Your commit message"
                 (The git add . command stages all the changes, and git commit saves them with a message describing what you changed.


      Step 3: Push the changes to the remote repository
              Finally, push the committed changes back to the lab’s GitHub repository using:
                bash:
                git push origin main
                (If your lab’s repository uses a different branch (e.g., master), replace main with the correct branch name. This will upload your changes to the repository on GitHub.)
