# SRA Software Department Recruitment Lab 2024

Welcome to the **SRA Software Department Recruitment Lab 2024**! This repository is designed to evaluate your learning ability. Please note that we are not testing your programming skills, so relax and focus on the tasks at hand.

We will be judging you based on various aspects throughout this activity. If you encounter issues, please take note of how you resolve them. You can also ask team members in the group chat for help. Your ability to communicate effectively and assist others will be considered as part of the evaluation process for your application.

## Requirements

Before you begin the lab, please ensure you have the following set up:

- **Git**: Ensure that Git is installed and properly configured on your computer. This means you should have your user information (such as your email and name) set up.
- **GitHub Account**: You will need a GitHub account to participate in this lab. If you don’t have one, please create it [here](https://github.com/join).
- **Technical Stack**: Make sure you have the necessary tools and software installed on your computer. 


## Instructions

If you have previously contributed to any open source community or worked on side projects, and you are applying for an coder position, you can bypass some of the lab tasks.

### Administor and Project leader
1. **Create a Markdown File**: Create a `.md` file in this repository.
2. **Link Your Repository**: In the Markdown file, provide links to your repository.
3. **Find Your Project Member**: You should ensure that others can deploy your project locally and make modifications based on it. To facilitate this, provide a brief tutorial on how to work with your project. Additionally, you need to find someone to deploy your project. This involves persuading them to use your project, assisting them with any issues they encounter, and tracking their progress.

### Coder
1. **Create a Directory Called `project`**:
   - Before you start your code journey. In the root directory (`/`) of your project, initiate git and create a new git branch called(`position/your-name` like `coder/rupert`)
   - Create a folder named `project` in the main directory of this repository.

3. **Find and Clone an Open Source Project**:
   - Choose an open-source project from the following options, or clone the project provided by the project leader or administrator who you choose to follow:
     - [React Documentation Website](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev)
     - [Flutter Documentation Website](https://github.com/flutter/website)
     - Any project you like and you understand what it did at least you can make modification based on it.
   - Clone the chosen project into the `project` folder you created.

4. **Make Changes Based on the Project You Cloned**:
   - Modify the cloned project to demonstrate your ability to quickly understand and work with an unfamiliar codebase.
   - Capture screenshots of your changes.
   - Save these screenshots in a separate folder named `img` within the root directory of this repository. The folder structure should look like this:
     ```
     .
     ├── README.md
     ├── project
     └── img
         ├── change-the-home-page.png
         ├── others.png
         └── ...
     ```

5. **Submit Your Work**:
   - Commit your changes to your forked repository (`/project/forked-repo`or `/project/`).
   -  **ENSURE YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN BRANCH NOT THE MAIN**, return to root directory (`/`) and commit your changes to that branch, 
   to do this, you have to know how to use git, you can follow the administor or project leader's tutorial or watch the video
   [git and github, en](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrTQipWp6co)
   or [一小时git教程, zh-CN](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HM411377j/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click). You should have a clear description of what you did by your commit message.
   
### Bonus Section

The above tasks are intended to assess your ability to learn unfamiliar topics, particularly in situations where you may have no prior experience in programming. The following are additional bonus tasks. While they are not the primary criteria for our selection process, excellent works in these tasks can set you apart from your peers in a competitive environment.
