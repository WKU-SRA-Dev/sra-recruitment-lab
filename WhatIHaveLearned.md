# What I have learned
This is the **first** time I have truly engaged with Git and GitHub.Due to my lack of proficiency in GitHub-related operations, I was initially unaware of all the requirements necessary for the Lab. Subsequently, with the assistance of multiple consultations and online resources, I eventually succeeded in uploading my repository.
